                    Choose a sedan for its suitability and economical factors.
                    Sedans are described as having "three-box" bodies: the front box is home to the engine; 
                    the middle box is larger and houses the passengers; and the third box, located in the rear, is the trunk. 
                    These are the classic proportions of a sedan and have been for more than 70 years.

                    Choose a SUV for large family members and enough money to feed them.
                    SUVs typically have high ground clearance and a tall body. This results in a high center of mass, which makes SUVs more prone to roll-over accidents.
                    SUVs were quoted as 2.5 times more likely to roll over in a crash than regular cars and that SUV roofs.

                Now, though, “luxury” can describe all kinds of vehicles, from compact coupes to large pickups, and the brand name alone may not be enough to separate the upper crust from the hoi polloi.
                Luxury cars often use higher-quality interior materials.Thats nice isn't it.
